🎓 Student Stress Prediction Model📖 Project OverviewMental health in academic settings is a growing concern. This project leverages Machine Learning to predict student stress levels based on academic, social, and personal habits.The Goal: To develop a predictive model that identifies students at risk of high stress (Early Intervention), allowing educational institutions to provide timely support and foster a healthier learning environment.📑 Table of ContentsData OverviewProject ArchitectureMethodologyFeature EngineeringInstallation & UsageKey ResultsFuture Roadmap📊 Data OverviewDataset: enhanced_student_habits_performance_dataset.csvSize: 80,000 entries | 31 columnsThe dataset covers a holistic view of student life:CategoryKey FeaturesDemographicsAge, Gender, Major📚 Study HabitsStudy hours/day, GPA, Time management, Study environment📱 Social HabitsSocial media usage, Netflix hours, Extracurriculars❤️ Well-beingSleep hours, Diet quality, Mental health rating, Stress level📈 PerformanceAttendance %, Exam score🏠 Socio-economicParental support, Income range, Internet quality🏗 Project ArchitectureBash├── data/

⚙️ Methodology1. Data PreprocessingCleaning: Removal of missing values (NaN) and duplicate rows.Optimization: Dropped student_id (non-predictive).Encoding: One-Hot Encoding applied to categorical variables (drop_first=True to prevent multicollinearity).Splitting: 80/20 Train-Test split with Stratification on the target variable to ensure balanced classes.2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)We utilized Count Plots and Box Plots to uncover relationships between lifestyle choices and exam performance.Key Insight: High screen time correlates with lower performance levels.Key Insight: Mental health ratings have a non-linear relationship with academic scores.3. Model TrainingTarget: Binary Classification (high_stress).1 (High Stress): Stress Level > 50 (Low/Normal Stress): Stress Level ≤ 5Algorithm: RandomForestClassifier (Selected for robustness against overfitting and ability to handle non-linear data).🧠 Feature EngineeringTo capture complex behavioral patterns, three custom features were engineered:Study_Sleep_InteractionFormula: $Study Hours \times Sleep Hours$Logic: Captures the productivity balance. High study with low sleep might yield different stress results than high study with high sleep.Social_Study_RatioFormula: $\frac{Social Media Hours}{Study Hours + 1e^{-6}}$Logic: Quantifies distraction. A small epsilon ($1e^{-6}$) is added to prevent division by zero errors.Total_Screen_TimeFormula: $Social Media Hours + Netflix Hours$Logic: Aggregates total recreational digital consumption.💻 Installation & UsageClone the repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/student-stress-prediction.git
